Assigment:	Create an application that allows the user to enter the number of calories and fat grams in a food.
The application should display the percentage of the calories that come from fat. If the calories
from fat are less than 30% of the total calories of the food, it should also display a message
indicating the food is low in fat.

One gram of fat has 9 calories, so:
Calories from fat = fat grams * 9

The percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as:
Percentage of calories from fat = Calories from fat / total calories
Input validation: Make sure the number of calories are not less than 0. Also, the number of
calories from fat cannot be greater than the total number of calories. If that happens, display an
error message indicating that either the calories or fat grams were incorrectly entered.

Use the following test data to determine if the application is calculating properly:
Calories and Fat Percentage Fat
200 calories, 8 fat grams Percentage of calories from fat: 36%
150 calories 2 fat grams Percentage of calories from fat: 12%(a low-fat food)
500 calories, 30 fat grams Percentage of calories from fat: 54%
